Hi, I’m Jonathan Korstad @Jpalmer95

       
I'm a Senior Accessibility Analyst & AI Solutions Engineer at VISA with a passion for technology and making the digital world more robust, accessible, and hopefully enjoyable for all!

I worked my way through college and graduated debt-free from Texas A&M University, all while working three jobs. After graduation, I pursued my hobbyist love for technology and continued honing my skills as a technologist. I also founded a coffee shop, Kynda Coffee. I recently completed my Post graduate program in Artificial Intelligence at UT Austin as well as 20+ other AIML certs and continue learning every day, especially within the great cross industry communities that you find on X and Hugging Face!

I'm a continuous learner, currently focused on anything related to AI/ML/DL (All Modalities), Reinforcement Learning, game development, and the future of digital technologies. So, if you're working on anything related to AI/ML/DL, developing something cool, game development, digital accessibility, or anything else for that matter (Cross disciplinary work is always a good time!), I'd love to collaborate with you! Let's work together to create something awesome.

Recently built MenuMetrics.org for advanced menu, recipe, and inventory calculations, tracking, and pricing to help small businesses or anyone with ingredients thrive. Free to use with Paid additional AI native features and even a managed plan for full inventory upload and management for the busy business owner.
