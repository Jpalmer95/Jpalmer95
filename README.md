Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan Korstad @Jpalmer95

A little bit about me:
       
I'm a Senior Accessibility Analyst at VISA with a passion for technology and making the digital world more accessible for all.

I worked my way through college and graduated debt-free from Texas A&M University, all while working three jobs. After graduation, I pursued my hobbyist love for technology and continued honing my skills as a technologist.

I'm always eager to learn new things, especially related to AI/ML/DL, game development, and the future of digital accessibility. So, if you're working on anything related to AI/ML/DL, software development, game development, or web accessibility, I'd love to collaborate with you! Let's work together to create something meaningful and impactful.

It's great to meet you!
