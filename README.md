Hi, I’m Jonathan Korstad @Jpalmer95

A little bit about me:
        I worked my way through college and graduated completey debt free from Texas A&M University. I started at a community college, then transferred in and worked 3 jobs to pay my own way through school. After college I opened a coffee shop, and then decided to pursue my hobbies in technology and change it into my career. I am a Senior Accessibility Analyst at VISA. I also love learning anything related to AI/ML/DL, Game Development, and of course digital A11y!

I’m interested in: machine learning, game development and web accessibility; or helping create something!

I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involving AI/ML/DL, Accessibility, software development, or game development!
