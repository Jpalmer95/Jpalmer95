# Hi there, I'm Jonathan Korstad (@Jpalmer95) 👋

**Senior Accessibility Analyst & AI Engineer | CPWA | Entrepreneur**

I am a results-driven AI Engineer with expertise in developing scalable AI agents and bridging the gap between digital accessibility and artificial intelligence. My work focuses on building intelligent systems using deep reinforcement learning and frameworks like LangChain and Smolagents to streamline operations and resolve complex queries. 

With a background spanning technology, healthcare, and construction, I bring a unique, cross-functional perspective to solving complex problems. I worked my way through college and graduated debt-free from Texas A&M University while juggling three jobs. Since then, I've completed a Post-graduate program in AI & Machine Learning at UT Austin, alongside 20+ other AIML certifications, and continue learning every day in communities like Hugging Face and X!

Currently, I serve as a Senior Accessibility Analyst and AI Software Engineer at **Visa**, where I lead global design and engineering teams to integrate accessibility into the product lifecycle. I am also the proud founder of **Kynda Coffee**.
